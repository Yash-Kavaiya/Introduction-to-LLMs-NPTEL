## Understanding Natural Language 🗣️

### Definition & Characteristics
```markdown
Natural Language:
A communication system that has:
- Evolved naturally
- Developed through human usage
- Emerged without formal planning
- Adapted through repetition
```

### Key Properties of Natural Languages
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Evolution** | Organic development over time |
| **Adaptability** | Changes based on usage patterns |
| **Complexity** | Multi-layered linguistic structures |
| **Cultural Context** | Embedded social and cultural elements |
